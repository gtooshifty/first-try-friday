# first-try-friday
## What is this project about?
This project is inspired by The Berrics' "First Try  Fridays" skateboarding series. Basically, skaters visiting The Berrics would have to land a random trick of choice first try, no warm up at all. Land or bail, it's getting recorded and posted to the youtube channel. More features to come.
